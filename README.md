# Cybersecurity-TinyOS-Encryption
Final project for Fundamentals of Cybersecurity demonstrating unencrypted and encrypted connections that transmit a password. Clearly, the un/encrypted folders have the respective communication. The man-in-the-middle folder contains code for a malicious host to hijack connection and transmit the password in plain text.

There is not much documentation to this repository due to the time crunch of finals week but nonetheless, feel free to take and use any code here.

### Secure Folder is old/outdatted
